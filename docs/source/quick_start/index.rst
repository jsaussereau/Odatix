Quick Start
===========

The easiest way to learn how to use Odatix is by exploring the integrated examples.

Try Odatix through examples
---------------------------

Here are two tutorials depending on you want to try first:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :hidden:
    
    fmax_synthesis
    simulations


.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card:: Try parallel Fmax synthesis
        :link: fmax_synthesis.html
        :text-align: center

        Run parallel Fmax synthesis flow on the EDA tool and technological target of your choice (FGPA or ASIC)

    .. grid-item-card:: Try parallel simulations
        :link: simulations.html
        :text-align: center

        Run parallel simulations on the simulator of your choice

.. If you would like to try Odatix Explorer without running all configurations, you can try it online with sample results:

.. .. card:: Try Odatix Explorer Online
..    :margin: auto
..    :width: 50%
..    :link: https://odatix.onrender.com
..    :text-align: center

..    Please note the deployment server can take up to a minute to start. Running Odatix Explorer locally is much faster. Thank you for your patience.

Try Odatix with your own design
--------------------------------

Once you have tried Odatix with the tutorials above, you can use it with your own designs. 

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :hidden:
    
    add_design
    add_simulation


.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card:: Add your own design
        :link: add_design.html
        :text-align: center

    .. grid-item-card:: Add your own simulation
        :link: add_simulation.html
        :text-align: center

        (A design must be defined first)
